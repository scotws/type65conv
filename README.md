Scot W. Stevenson <scot.stevenson@gmail.com>

This is a BETA version of a tool to convert Typist's Assembler Notation code
for the 6502/65c02/65816 to traditional formats. 

BETA means "everything should work, but it probably doesn't".  Use at your own risk. 

See `docs/MANUAL.txt` for further information.
